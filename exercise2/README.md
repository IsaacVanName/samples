# Exercise 2 (Challenge B)

This corresponds to challenge B (**"Write a front-end single page app (JavaScript + React*)"**). React is my favorite choice for SPAs, so I was more than happy to solve with that. Given the time constraints, I went a bit simpler on the implementation. Backend uses Hapi as the API.

## Running the solution

The solution uses Webpack and NPM, so running the application should be as simple as (from within the `exercise2` directory):

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run run` (runs webpack build and the hapi server process)

From there, you should be able to navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in a web browser to see the application. Entering a URL in the text box and clicking the button should show links. It's not required to include the 'http://' at the front. I tested with myemma.com. :-)
