# Exercise 1 (Challenge A)

This corresponds to challenge A (**"Write a function in Python, JavaScript, or Scala"**). I wrote this one in Python since it was an option, and in order to have the option to use server-side JavaScript in challenge B.

## Running the solution

The check_urls.py file contains both the function to check a list of URLs and a line at the bottom that tests the function with correct and incorrect URLs.

To run, just run `python check_urls.py` from within the `exercise1` directory. If you have multiple Python versions, you might need to run `python3` instead of `python`.
