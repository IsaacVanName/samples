# Code Challenge Solutions

Given the two code challenges, I solved them both to indicate an interest in continued full stack development. However, I wanted to solve them in separate languages for both server-side implementations, so I split up the exercises.

I also named them 1 and 2 because a and b at the end of directory names seemed odd.

## Exercise 1 (Challenge A)

This corresponds to challenge A (**"Write a function in Python, JavaScript, or Scala"**). I wrote this one in Python since it was an option, and in order to have the option to use server-side JavaScript in challenge B.

## Exercise 2 (Challenge B)

This corresponds to challenge B (**"Write a front-end single page app (JavaScript + React*)"**). React is my favorite choice for SPAs, so I was more than happy to solve with that. Given the time constraints, I went a bit simpler on the implementation. Backend uses Hapi as the (simplistic) API.
